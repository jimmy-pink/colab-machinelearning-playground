# colab-machinelearning-playground

This repository contains a collection of deep learning experiments, Kaggle projects, and self-implemented deep learning models/agents. It includes hands-on work from learning the fundamentals of deep learning, through to more advanced applications like transfer learning and reinforcement learning-based agents. All the code is written in Python and organized into Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb).

## Contents



- **deeplearning.ai**: 
	- Coursera deeplearning.ai presentation materials and Lab implementation
- **Kaggle Experiments**: 
	- Various beginner to intermediate-level Kaggle competitions and datasets, with model implementations and results.  
	- TensorFlow dataset model training
- **Deep Learning Projects**: 
	- Self-implemented projects that explore different deep learning techniques, including transfer learning, generative models, and reinforcement learning.  
- **Custom Implementations**: 
	- Special deep learning models like a voice cloning model using transfer learning, and a micro-agent using Long Chain and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technologies.

## Project Highlights

- **Voice Cloning with Transfer Learning**: A project that demonstrates using transfer learning to clone voices, training the model on a custom dataset to synthesize speech.
  
- **Micro-Agent using Long Chain and RAG**: A unique application of reinforcement learning techniques where an agent learns from its environment using the combination of Long Chain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following libraries to run the notebooks in this repository:
- Python 3.11.11
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Keras
- HuggingFace Transformers (for NLP and RAG-related projects)
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)

To install the required libraries, you can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
